STEPS
1.Downloaded Covid_data in json format from the given link in the pdf using wget command.
2.Created a shell script "cs253_assign_2_190457.sh".
 and wrote following commands in it to process the data.
3.Created a csv file named "processed_Covid_Data_190457.csv" to and wrote headers in the required format using >> command.
4.Now wrote jq command to extract number of state, then started a for loop for each state, then used jq command to find code of each state.
5.There was one state named TT such that its data was null so I deleted it while using jq commands. 
5.Now extracted number of district in each state using jq command, then created a nested for loop for each district of each state, then used jq command to find name of each district.
7.Calculated confirmed and recovered cases for each district using jq commands.
6.Calculated recovery rate of each district by and stored the name of district with maximum recovery rate, also stored maximum recovery rate and total confirmed cases of that district. 
7.Used if statements at appropriate place to handle boundary conditions, i.e., ignored district with name "Unknown", all districts in a state having less than 5000 confirmed cases and a particular district having less than 5000 confirmed cases.
8.Now, used >> comamand to redirect the state name, district name with maximum recovery rate, total confirmed cases and recovery rate of that district to our csv file.
9.Now executed our script using command bash cs253_assign_2_190457.sh.
